# Happiness Report Data
Visualizations for the Reddit DataViz Challenge June.
Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/henosergoyan/happiness/data

Either use the Jupyter Notebook or run

```shell
python main.py
```

Known problem: The naming convention in the Kaggle data set and geopands is different for some countries. Therefore some countries are missing in the plot.
